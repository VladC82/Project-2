Deployment:
- This website was creating using Visual Studio, a local git directory was used for version control, and then uploaded to GitHub. I have made it live using Git pages. To do this I initiated the git repository with 'git innit', then used 'git status' to see which of my un-tracked files had not been added to the new repository. I used 'git commit -m "added in a specific message" to commit my changed files to the repository. Once my files were committed I used 'git push' to push all my new and changed files to GitHub before making it live with Git pages. I did this every time I made major changes to any part of my site.
